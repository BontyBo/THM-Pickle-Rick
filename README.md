<h3 align="center">--- Objective ---</h3>

- Find three ingredients by exploiting the web server provided in this room
<br>
<h3 align="center">--- Approach ---</h3>
1. Enumeration : 
The easiest way to gather information about a web server is to retrieve its content, so we start there.

![landing page](screenshots/landing.png)
![landing_page_source](screenshots/landing_source.png)

The HTML page source reveals a username that we might be able to use elsewhere. This is a good start!
<hr>
Next, I use some tool to reveal hidden content of this web server. I ran an nmap script to explore pages and directories.

Command: `nmap --script discovery <web url> -p80`

![enum_nmap](screenshots/enum.png)

The screenshot shows that it has robots.txt and login.php . The robots.txt file often gives useful clues about a site's structure, so I checked it first.

![robots](screenshots/robots.png)

The robots file content looked like a gibberish at first, so I continued to login.php <br>

2. Sensitive Data Explosure

![login](screenshots/loginportal.png)

The login requires both username and password. I suspected the username is the one we got from the idex page source<br>
`Username: R1ckRul3s`<br>
I didn't know the password, so I tried brute-forcing with rockyou and Seclist wordlists, but it didn't work.<br>
I then tried the gibberish from robots.txt and it was the password. <br>

3. Remote Code Execution

![command](screenshots/command.png)

There is a form that executes command on target machine.

![user](screenshots/user.png)

We're running as www-data.

I started by listing current directory.

![list_www](screenshots/list_www.png)

We found Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt, which might be the first flag. But when I tried to get content of the file.

![cat_first](screenshots/cat_first.png)

It seem we cannot execute this command. My guess was I might be able to execute this but with user with right privilege or the command `cat` is restricted.
<br>
I checked if there are any privilege misconfiguration and I got
![check_perm](screenshots/check_perm.png)
We could run commands as root (No password).
<br>
Now I tried running `cat` as root
![super_cat_first](screenshots/super_cat_first.png)
Now it's confirmed that we cannot run `cat`. So how can we read the file?
<br>
There are many ways to extract file contents for example:
Command: `base64 Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt | base64 -d`
![alter_first](screenshots/alter_first.png)

With this, we can easily get the first ingredient.
And I also check clue.txt in the directory.

![hint](screenshots/hint.png)

This suggests all ingredient are stored somewhere in the filesystem.
Next I checked the home directory (It's common to store flag in home directory)

![check_home](screenshots/check_home.png)
![alter_second](screenshots/alter_second.png)

This gave the second flag. I looked for the last flag in other home directory but found nothing, 
so I go back to root of file system.

![list_root](screenshots/list_root.png)

The last flag might be in a root-only location so I checked /root directory
![list_root_root](screenshots/list_root_root.png)
![alter_final](screenshots/alter_final.png)

<h3 align="center">--- Conclusion ---</h3>
Pickle Rick room is an enjoyable room that reinforces enumeration and basic Linux command skills. The web shell helps skip some steps, making the room beginner-friendly. If you're new to CTFs or web enumeration, this room is a good introduction.
